# damp

This is a fork of [bump](https://github.com/disruptek/bump/) that uses the simple and flexible DateVer system (year.month.day) instead of the complex and vague SemVer system (number-of-times-something-changed.number-of-times-something-was-added-since-something-changed.number-of-times-nothing-changed-since-something-was-added).

I just did some quick and dirty changes to the original project, so use at your own risk.
